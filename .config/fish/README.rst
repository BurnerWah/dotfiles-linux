====================
 Fish Configuration
====================

Fish is user-friendly shell. It has compatibility issues with some programs.

Notes
-----

* Fish generates completions from manpages by running ``fish_update_completions``.
  It uses sections 1 (normal commands), 6 (games), and 8 (admin commands)
* If a function doesn't have a description, it will fall back to a description
  from a manpage.
