===================
 Zsh configuration
===================

This is just the Zsh configuration I've developed over time. Some things worth
specifying in advance are:

* I don't use a plugin manager. They add **absurd** amounts of complexity to
  the shell startup process for what is basically a glorified ``source``
  wrapper.
* I only really use aliases to apply default arguments & wrapping commands to
  programs. If it's just a shortened version of a command I'd rather have it
  expand to the full thing as I type it.
* I don't use many plugins. Usually they're either unnecessary, work poorly,
  break something, define an obscene number of variables, or do something else
  along those lines.
