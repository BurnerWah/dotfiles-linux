 Fish Configuration
####################

Fish is an easy to use, well made shell that isn't compatible with as much
stuff.

Things worth knowing
####################

* Fish generates completions from manpages whenever ``fish_update_completions``
  is run.
  It uses sections 1 (normal commands), 6 (games), and 8 (admin commands)
* If a function doesn't have a description, it will fall back to a description
  from a manpage.
